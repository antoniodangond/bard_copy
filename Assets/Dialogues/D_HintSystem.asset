  - Slip through the gate where the animals lie to find THE TAIL.
  - If you seek the LEFT LEG, enter the temple below and choose right.
  - Deep in the forest, a quiet glade cradles the RIGHT LEG.
  - A greedy bird guards the LEFT ARM in a desert graveyard.
  - The RIGHT ARM is tucked in a nearby hollow you passed without a second thought.
  - High upon the tallest peak, THE TORSO lays in winter's cold grasp.
  - In the northern forest, the LEFT HEAD rests in a perilous grotto.
  - In the burrow of serpents, beyond a wall of frost, the MIDDLE HEAD lies still.
  - Where tide greets earth, travel south and face restless shades to find the RIGHT
    HEAD.
