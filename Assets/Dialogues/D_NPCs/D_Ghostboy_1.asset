  - Have you seen my mom? I can't find her...
  - She would always sing me this lullaby. She wrote it on a scroll in the mausoleum.
  - I'm too scared to go myself - plus there's a big tree blocking the way.
  - Would you go learn the song and play it for me?
  - I heard there might be a hidden entrace... try pushing one of the graves.
